# Embedding Pictures

This exercise contains five small programs which illustrate embedding topics
in Ocean and on the D-Wave QPUs, for Training features.

## Exercise 1

At the command line, to run the demo:

```bash
python clique_embedding_chimera.py 8
```

If you're running in the Leap IDE, open a Terminal, and then run this command.

The program will produce a picture with a left and right side. The left side
is an 8-clique and the right picture is an example Chimera embedding of an
8-clique.

## Exercise 2

At the command line, to run the demo:

```bash
python clique_embedding_pegasus.py 8
```

If you're running in the Leap IDE, open a Terminal, and then run this command.

The program will produce a picture with a left and right side. The left side
is an 8-clique and the right picture is an example Pegasus embedding of an
8-clique.

## Exercise 3

At the command line, to run the demo:

```bash
python explore_embed_clique_chimera.py 4
```

If you're running in the Leap IDE, open a Terminal, and then run this command.

The output of the program will be a typical Chimera embedding of a 4-clique.

## Exercise 4

At the command line, to run the demo:

```bash
python explore_embed_clique_pegasus.py 4
```

If you're running in the Leap IDE, open a Terminal, and then run this command.

The output of the program will be a typical Pegasus embedding of a 4-clique.
