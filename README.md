# Embedding Pictures

This exercise contains six small programs which illustrate embedding topics
in Ocean and on the D-Wave QPUs, for Training features.

## Exercise 1

To run the demo, at the command line, type:

```python embedding_clique_chimera.py 8```

If you're running in the Leap IDE, open a Terminal, and then run this command.

The program will print out how many qubits were required for the embedding and
produce an image file ```embedding_clique_chimera.png``` in your working
directory. This file contains a picture with a left and right side. The left
side of the image is an 8-clique and the right is an example Chimera embedding
of an 8-clique.

## Exercise 2

To run the demo, at the command line, type:

```python embedding_clique_pegasus.py 8```

If you're running in the Leap IDE, open a Terminal, and then run this command.

The program will print out how many qubits were required for the embedding and
produce an image file ```embedding_clique_pegasus.png``` in your working
directory. This file contains a picture with a left and right side. The left
side of the image is an 8-clique and the right is an example Pegasus embedding
of an 8-clique.

## Exercise 3

To run the demo, at the command line, type:

```python explore_embed_clique_chimera.py 4```

If you're running in the Leap IDE, open a Terminal, and then run this command.

The output of the program will be a typical Chimera embedding of a 4-clique.

## Exercise 4

To run the demo, at the command line, type:

```python explore_embed_clique_pegasus.py 4```

If you're running in the Leap IDE, open a Terminal, and then run this command.

The output of the program will be a typical Pegasus embedding of a 4-clique.

## Exercise 5

To run the demo, at the command line, type:

```python clique_embedding_chimera.py 8```

If you're running in the Leap IDE, open a Terminal, and then run this command.

The program will print out how many qubits were required for the embedding and
produce an image file ```clique_embedding_chimera.png``` in your working
directory. This file contains a picture with a left and right side. The left
side of the image is an 8-clique and the right is an example Chimera embedding,
using the 2014 clique embedding algorithm, of an 8-clique.

## Exercise 6

To run the demo, at the command line, type:

```python clique_embedding_pegasus.py 8```

If you're running in the Leap IDE, open a Terminal, and then run this command.

The program will print out how many qubits were required for the embedding and
produce an image file ```clique_embedding_pegasus.png``` in your working
directory. This file contains a picture with a left and right side. The left
side of the image is an 8-clique and the right is an example Pegasus embedding,
using the 2014 clique embedding algorithm, of an 8-clique.
